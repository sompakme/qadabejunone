Here, 11 women reveal their physical scars—and open up about the mental ones—to break the stigma and set the record straight.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Renee Marhong was sure she knew exactly how things were going to go. She’d go into labor naturally and head to the hospital with her baby’s father. She’d push a couple of times, and then the doctor would gently lay her first child on her chest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Instead, at 32 weeks pregnant, her son stopped moving inside her, and to save his life, she delivered via cesarean section. Marhong was 25, and her only experience with childbirth was the Hollywood version: a smooth, uncomplicated, vaginal delivery. When she didn’t get that, she says, she felt “robbed of that experience you see on TV. Like I did get the baby, but without the recognition, without that happy moment.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Marhong was wheeled into the operating room to deliver her son via C-section, she became one of the more than <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/delivery.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1.2 million" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">1.2 million</a> American women who have babies that way every year. According to the Center of Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics, 32 percent of all births in the U.S. happen via C-section, a number that’s risen dramatically in recent decades.</p><img alt="White, Black, Facial expression, Brassiere, Smile, Beauty, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Lip, Skin, " title="White, Black, Facial expression, Brassiere, Smile, Beauty, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Lip, Skin, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/10-1567012319.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Before getting pregnant, Renee Marhong's only experience with childbirth had been the Hollywood version: a uncomplicated vaginal delivery.</p><img alt="Black, Stomach, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, Skin, Hand, Abdomen, Monochrome, Joint, Organ, " title="Black, Stomach, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, Skin, Hand, Abdomen, Monochrome, Joint, Organ, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/10-1567011642.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Marhong was 25 when she delivered her first child via emergency C-section. She says she felt “robbed of that experience you see on TV.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are two reasons for a C-section; those that happen in an emergency situation, when the mother or baby is in jeopardy, and elective C-sections, which can be scheduled and planned for ahead of time. By and large, the procedure is safe. So safe, in fact, that more and more mothers-to-be are opting for the latter, electing to schedule a C-section rather than wait to go into labor naturally. There are, of course, any number of reasons to choose a C-section: It can reduce the chance of long-term pelvic floor and incontinence issues, and can be scheduled at both the parents’ and doctors’ convenience, ensuring that your obstetrician—and not the stranger who happens to be on duty when you go into labor—delivers your baby. When a mother has a condition like high blood pressure or obesity, is over the age of 35, or if the baby is “breech” (positioned butt- or feet-first in the birth canal), the pregnancy may be considered “high risk.” In those cases, an elective C-section can be the best way to ensure that both mom and baby get through delivery safely.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But a C-section is still major abdominal surgery, and as rates of the procedure rise, so does the risk of complications—and lasting emotional trauma—for mothers. Studies and statistics find that women who deliver via C-section are more likely to have medical issues including uterine ruptures and emergency hysterectomies. Even when all goes well physically, the ordeal can contribute to postpartum mental health issues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite how common the procedure has become, C-sections are rarely portrayed on TV, and little has been done to normalize the conversation around them. Add to that common misconceptions about C-section—that it’s “the easy way out” or a vanity-driven choice—and a dip in self-esteem that can accompany the tell-tale scarring, and women may face a physical and mental recovery period that takes months, or even years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>______</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Two weeks after giving birth to her second son, Lazlo, in 2017, Jenny Mollen shared a mirror selfie on Instagram. In the seemingly-unfiltered shot, her pinstriped robe hangs open, revealing a long scar between her pelvic bones. “Because I wish somebody had shown me a pic like this 9 months ago, I’d like to insist this be your new business card,” Mollen wrote in the caption, mentioning her obstetrician and using hashtags like #csection and #keepingitreal.</p><img alt="Photograph, Beauty, Art model, Black-and-white, Photography, Photo shoot, Model, Muscle, Arm, Eye, " title="Photograph, Beauty, Art model, Black-and-white, Photography, Photo shoot, Model, Muscle, Arm, Eye, " width=2000 height=2667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hdm080119-1567700746.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Jenny Mollen knew from the start of her second pregnancy that she’d likely deliver via C-section, just as she had her first son.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Chest, Black, Trunk, Muscle, Barechested, Skin, Stomach, Shoulder, Neck, " title="Abdomen, Chest, Black, Trunk, Muscle, Barechested, Skin, Stomach, Shoulder, Neck, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-1568220553.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>For her second C-section, Mollen felt more prepared and less anxious, and explains that now, she wants to help other women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The candidness with which Mollen, who now has two sons with fellow actor Jason Biggs, shared her scar on social media isn’t off-brand for the author of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/Live-Fast-Die-Jenny-Mollen/dp/1101969989/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/142-0243038-4026356?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1101969989&pd_rd_r=5d7ddcd6-3b50-46a0-b6ca-47537cb42ca9&pd_rd_w=GQITO&pd_rd_wg=CxTZh&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A&psc=1&refRID=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="I Like You Just the Way I Am" data-vars-ga-product-id=d7f9b380-44fa-4f8d-a713-3a2e9707bac1 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Live-Fast-Die-Jenny-Mollen/dp/1101969989/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/142-0243038-4026356?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1101969989&pd_rd_r=5d7ddcd6-3b50-46a0-b6ca-47537cb42ca9&pd_rd_w=GQITO&pd_rd_wg=CxTZh&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A&psc=1&refRID=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/Live-Fast-Die-Jenny-Mollen/dp/1101969989/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/142-0243038-4026356?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1101969989&pd_rd_r=5d7ddcd6-3b50-46a0-b6ca-47537cb42ca9&pd_rd_w=GQITO&pd_rd_wg=CxTZh&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A&psc=1&refRID=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Live-Fast-Die-Jenny-Mollen/dp/1101969989/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/142-0243038-4026356?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1101969989&pd_rd_r=5d7ddcd6-3b50-46a0-b6ca-47537cb42ca9&pd_rd_w=GQITO&pd_rd_wg=CxTZh&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A&psc=1&refRID=FZBN9TS7HNSZJ3TR3C3A" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f3547caf-b099-4bcb-b98f-6bfd3d0153c3 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">I Like You Just the Way I Am</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1101969989 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Live Fast, Die Hot" data-vars-ga-product-id=571d3539-4e28-475b-9768-f953ed161916 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1101969989 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1101969989 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1101969989 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=Anchor data-vars-ga-product-price=$16.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2c45a699-8c02-461e-b062-916d48cdbbed data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Anchor data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Actors & Entertainers" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Live Fast, Die Hot</a>, a pair of blunt, occasionally raunchy memoirs. Throughout her pregnancy, Mollen posted nude or almost-nude photos, and wrote openly about being diagnosed with placenta previa, a condition where the placenta covers the cervix. She knew from the start of her second pregnancy that she’d likely deliver Lazlo via C-section, just as she had her first son, Sid.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My mom had to have an emergency C-section; she never dilated,” Mollen says. “So, going into my first pregnancy I felt like, ‘oh my God, this is going to happen to me.’ I tried and tried, I labored for hours, I mean like 16 hours. [The doctor was] like, ‘You're like half a centimeter dilated. There's a 99 percent chance you're not going to have this baby vaginally.’ At that point I was like ‘alright, just fucking cut me.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For her second C-section, Mollen felt more prepared and less anxious, and explains that she wanted to help other women, if she could. “For me, it wasn’t a scary thing. I feel like a lot of women have fear and anxiety around it, and I wanted to show the progression of what it looks like a week after, two weeks after.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While that kind of openness is normal for Mollen, she’s the exception to the rule. Many women hesitate to reveal their C-section scars, which can vary from straight and barely-there, like Mollen’s (she had a laser procedure to make it less visible) to more jagged and prominent. Some retain a “flap” of scar tissue above or below their scar. Others end up with two scars; one vertical, one horizontal. But while millions of women carry these scars, many say they had no idea what their scar “should” look like. These ten mothers agreed to be photographed because they believe that needs to change.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>We’re sold a fairy tale, and women are afraid to share the reality.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Before this photo shoot, I was like, ‘Oh my god, what am I doing?’ But I know women need to see it,” Marhong says. “I need to see this. People need to see this, so we can normalize it. Millions of women get C-sections and we really don’t discuss it at all. It’s important that we normalize it that so many people have the scar, and that you get that little piece of fat there, and it’s whatever, it’s fine.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not just the scarring that goes undiscussed. Most childbirth classes include only a passing mention of C-section, if they cover it at all. That leaves a statistical one third of expectant mothers totally unprepared for the procedure they’ll ultimately undergo.</p><img alt="Brassiere, Black, White, Undergarment, Clothing, Undergarment, Lingerie, Beauty, Chest, Skin, " title="Brassiere, Black, White, Undergarment, Clothing, Undergarment, Lingerie, Beauty, Chest, Skin, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5-1567012223.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>While pregnant with her first child, Carolyn Gionelli attended birthing classes that she says barely touched on what an emergency C-section would be like.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Stomach, Navel, Skin, Waist, Trunk, Organ, Monochrome photography, Muscle, Black-and-white, " title="Abdomen, Stomach, Navel, Skin, Waist, Trunk, Organ, Monochrome photography, Muscle, Black-and-white, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5-1567011385.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>When her stalled labor ultimately turned into an unplanned C-section, Gionelli says her lack of preparation left her terrified.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While she was pregnant with her first child, Carolyn Gionelli remembers attending birthing classes that seemed to assume everyone would be giving birth vaginally, and barely touched on what an emergency C-section would be like.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There is no education, they just don’t talk to you about it,” she says. “You’re in these classes and it’s just about your dilation and when you’ll push and all that stuff, and I think you get your mind set on that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gionelli remembers turning to her husband in that birthing class and telling him she didn’t want a C-section, “no matter what happens.” But when her stalled labor did ultimately turn into an unplanned C-section, Gionelli’s lack of preparation left her terrified.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I had never broken a bone, never had to have surgery, so I was petrified,” she says. “And then when everything was going down and I didn’t have a choice and there I was on the table…it’s scary.”</p><img alt="Brassiere, Black, Face, Lingerie, Lip, Skin, Beauty, Black hair, Model, Undergarment, " title="Brassiere, Black, Face, Lingerie, Lip, Skin, Beauty, Black hair, Model, Undergarment, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/4-1567012207.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>After being diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, Danielle Harding underwent an emergency C-section at seven months pregnant.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Trunk, Skin, Monochrome photography, Chest, Organ, Navel, Black-and-white, " title="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Trunk, Skin, Monochrome photography, Chest, Organ, Navel, Black-and-white, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/4-1567011328.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>“I love my scar,” says 27-year-old Harding. “Women should be proud of the strength they had during and after the procedure.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Spending time during prenatal consultations and birthing classes talking about the potential for a C-section, and preparing women for what that could be like, Marhong says, may make the experience less traumatic. But it’s not just medical professionals who should be doing the talking.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s important, Marhong adds, for women whose birth experiences didn’t look like the typical TV scene (“the woman screaming, then the baby sliding out,”) to talk about what it was like.

After a stalled induction and 30 hours of labor, she delivered via C-section. It wasn’t until four months later that a psychiatrist labeled her flashbacks, night terrors, and deep sadness with a name: PTSD.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Remember that at the root of trauma is fear,” Brodesser-Akner wrote in 2010. “In my case, intervention after intervention left me more scared, more sure that no one was looking out for me. When they told me that both my baby and I were in distress — my heart rate was off the charts, and he'd been experiencing contractions for more than a day — I could not see an outcome in which things turned out OK. That feeling that you're in danger, when it stays with you, is the essence of PTSD.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dekel is currently studying an additional hypothesis that emergency C-sections also lead to CB-PTSD at an increased rate because of an instant shift in hormones.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There are drastic biological and physiological and hormonal changes in the context of having a C-section,” Dekel says. “It’s a rollercoaster of hormones, and a drastic interruption in the natural birth experience. It could be that the combination of biological and psychological stressors increases the risk for elevated psychiatric symptoms postpartum.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At most hospitals, Dekel says, part of a postpartum evaluation is a routine screening for depression. “Nobody is screening for PTSD,” she says. And, considering the rate of C-section births in the U.S. is at 32 percent and rising, “there are a lot of women who are potentially at risk.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The recovery was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even women who don’t develop symptoms of PTSD may not be getting the support they really need to effectively heal. After a normal vaginal delivery—assuming there are no serious complications—a new mom is up and moving within a day or so. During a C-section, a surgeon slices through the abdominal wall and its attached muscles, then makes a second incision in the uterus. Once the baby and placenta are delivered, both are stitched back up. For as long as six weeks, recovering mothers aren’t able to engage their core muscles at all. That means things like sitting, standing, or lifting a newborn are nearly impossible to do without help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tyla Jones Champion, 28, had an emergency C-section after the umbilical cord became wrapped around her daughter’s neck during labor.

You never realize it, but you use your stomach for everything.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Champion’s boyfriend and mother were with her for the first few days after her delivery, but “everybody had to go back to work sooner than I hoped,” she says. It was weeks before she felt like she could even get in and out of bed normally. “They tell you to plan,” she says, of the days immediately following childbirth. “Plan this, plan that. Then it’s, ‘Oh, crap. Now I have a C-section and an extra four weeks recovery time.” Aspects of recovery, she adds, just can’t be planned for. “You have to relearn everything about your body: how to cough the right way, or sit the right way when you’re going to the bathroom, or how to squat to pick something up when the baby drops it. It’s very, very difficult.”</p><img alt="Brassiere, Black, Face, Hair, White, Lip, Facial expression, Lingerie, Beauty, Skin, " title="Brassiere, Black, Face, Hair, White, Lip, Facial expression, Lingerie, Beauty, Skin, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/11-1568220759.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Tyla Jones Champion, 28, had an emergency C-section after the umbilical cord became wrapped around her daughter’s neck during labor.</p><img alt="White, Skin, Joint, Close-up, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Leg, Abdomen, Arm, Knee, " title="White, Skin, Joint, Close-up, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Leg, Abdomen, Arm, Knee, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/11-square-1568220782.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The recovery “was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life,” Champion says. “I couldn’t do anything.

Jessica Delfino, 42, remembers the birth of her son, Wyatt, via C-section as “kind of nice” in its painlessness. “But there's no way to escape it because afterwards the pain was like a real kick in the guts,” she says. “For a couple weeks it hurt pretty badly. I would have to do things like take the baby and lift him to nurse him. They gave me medicine, but the medicine made me feel so foggy, and I wasn't really sure how gentle I was being with the baby. I couldn't really feel his weight, and he was so light. It made me feel so nervous to hold him on this medication that I just really didn't take it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The surgical recovery is compounded exponentially, adds Gionelli, who’s now had three children via C-section, by the demands of motherhood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In walks my 15-month-old, who wants me to pick him up and hold him,” she says. “What am I going to do?

But the National Center for Health Statistics reported in 2013 that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/health/two-weeks-after-baby-more-new-moms-cut-maternity-leave-4B11229443 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="16 percent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">16 percent</a> of new moms only took between one and four weeks, and nearly a third didn’t take any formal time away from work. For some, this is because maternity leave isn’t even an option: The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/fmla data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Family and Medical Leave Act" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Family and Medical Leave Act</a> requires that companies with more than 50 employees offer up to 12 weeks of leave to employees who’ve been at the company at least a year. But if you or your workplace don’t meet those requirements, there’s no law that protects your job while you recover. Plus, the FMLA simply makes sure your position is waiting for you when you get back. It doesn’t require your company to pay you while you’re gone, meaning that leave could be completely unpaid. Many families simply can’t withstand a 12-week-long loss of income.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The result is that many women end up going back to work much too soon after major abdominal surgery, and sacrificing the benefits that come with taking time off to bond with their newborn. Studies show a strong correlation between mental health and maternity leave: The longer the leave, the fewer depressive symptoms were recorded.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delfino says that while she’s grateful for the modern medical practices that helped her deliver safely, it was a year before she felt physically normal, and much longer before she really felt like herself again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I was really mentally affected by my C-section, as much or more so than physically,” Delfino says. “I felt almost betrayed, in a sense, by my body. That was an emotional thing I had to work through and come to terms with.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But this, too, is often swept under the rug. The stigma associated with C-section is tough to shake, and it can make things that much tougher for postpartum moms. “You can feel like a failure, like you didn’t do it the way god—if you’re religious—intended,” Marhong says. “Some people say things like, ‘Oh, you took the easy way out,’ which is completely insane.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But when women internalize the misconceptions that a C-section and the recovery is somehow easier, or, at least, as straightforward as vaginal delivery, they can be left feeling confused, depressed, and bitter, and like they’re not entitled to the help they really need.</p><img alt="Brassiere, Black, White, Clothing, Lingerie, Undergarment, Beauty, Undergarment, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, " title="Brassiere, Black, White, Clothing, Lingerie, Undergarment, Beauty, Undergarment, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/7-1567012260.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Jackie Helchowski has undergone three C-sections—the first, at age 21, was an emergency; the second and third were planned to avoid rupturing the scar on the uterus.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Trunk, Skin, Chest, Waist, Navel, Organ, Muscle, " title="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Trunk, Skin, Chest, Waist, Navel, Organ, Muscle, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/7-1567011508.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>“I was a little vain about my scar,” Helchowski admits. “And I did feel cheated out of childbirth.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s rough,” Marhong says. “It’s not just sadness.

Humans have been performing C-sections for millennia. References to C-section births appear in folklore and historical records from the ancient Greeks to the ancient Chinese, but the name is most likely derived from “caedare;” Latin for, “to cut.” And, of course, it wasn’t always the relatively low-risk procedure it is today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The indications for it have changed dramatically from ancient to modern times,” writes Dr. Jane Elliott Sewell, in a 1993 brochure that accompanied an exhibit on the procedure at the National Library of Medicine. “Despite rare references to the operation on living women, the initial purpose was essentially to retrieve the infant from a dead or dying mother; this was conducted either in the rather vain hope of saving the baby's life, or as commonly required by religious edicts, so the infant might be buried separately from the mother. Above all it was a measure of last resort, and the operation was not intended to preserve the mother's life.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I felt betrayed by my body.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, a C-section, especially one performed because mom or baby is in distress, can be very much a life-saving measure.

Additionally, the research team believes doctors, who ultimately benefit more from the pricier and quicker surgical procedure than from a long, drawn-out vaginal birth, are incentivized to push their patients toward an unnecessary C-section.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=79 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the nearly five percent of women whose babies are in a breech presentation when they reach term, a C-section may be a foregone conclusion.

But the research community has long debated the drug’s effectiveness, and more recent studies suggest it might be overused. Some hypothesize that Pitocin can actually stall active labor, increasing the odds of an emergency C-section.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=90 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15567643 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2004 review" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2004 review</a> of data from more than 1,500 women found that women who were given Pitocin to induce labor (as opposed to being given the drug after they were actively contracting) requested anesthesia sooner, and were at a higher risk for emergency C-section. Brodesser-Akner’s own traumatic labor began with a Pitocin induction, and her recent debut novel, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525510877 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fleishman is in Trouble" data-vars-ga-product-id=d832d52b-7ea8-4e70-8c95-7c4f52b42764 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525510877 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525510877 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525510877 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Random House" data-vars-ga-product-price=$10.72 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=114dcf7e-a315-4a37-9739-22b39612eaf7 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Random House" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Family Life" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Fleishman is in Trouble</a>, contains a Pitocin-induced C-section scene that seems to mirror the experience she and so many others have had in the operating room.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=91 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In many cases, women may feel uncomfortable—or even unable—when it comes to advocating for themselves with doctors they don’t have a relationship with. There was a time when, Tanya Wills says, “you knew [your doctor] by name; you called them in the middle of the night when you went into labor.” That model of care has more or less vanished.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=92 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Women are put through maternity care in a factory sort of system in a practice with 10 doctors, none of whom know them; they just read their chart, go in, and deliver the baby,” she says. “I think a lot of people wind up falling through the cracks.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>People are put through maternity care in a factory sort of system.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=94 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bias, conscious or not, plays a role, too. Research finds that implicit racial bias causes doctors to ignore the symptoms or underestimate the pain level, and spend less time overall, with patients of color. Black women in the United States undergo C-sections at a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23281861 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="higher rate" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">higher rate</a> than any other group, and are also up to four times more likely than white women to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/02/20/why-are-black-women-at-such-high-risk-of-dying-from-pregnancy-complications data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="die of complications" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">die of complications</a> during childbirth. As part of a 2017 investigative story for the radio show <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2017/12/07/568948782/black-mothers-keep-dying-after-giving-birth-shalon-irvings-story-explains-why data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="All Things Considered" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">All Things Considered</a>, NPR and ProPublica collected birth stories from more than 200 women of color. Nearly all of them reported feeling ignored or dismissed by the healthcare professionals who were supposed to be helping.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=95 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tied to this, Wills believes, is the country’s rate of fetal mortality, which remains one of the highest among developed nations. In general, she says, the impact on mothers is closely tied to how they’re treated by their doctors. “I think it’s complicated,” she says, “but it has to do with how institutionalized racism affects who really gets what they need, who has access and who doesn’t, who gets listened to and who doesn’t.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=96 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jones-Champion says she felt like her doctors were more interested in “hurrying things along” when she went into labor with her first baby, rather than in helping her give birth the way she’d planned. “I think they put me at risk instead of just trying to help me,” Jones-Champion says. There were other things, she learned later, she feels her doctors could have attempted to speed up her labor naturally.</p><img alt="Black, Clothing, Chest, Beauty, Model, Muscle, Brassiere, Abdomen, Lip, Black-and-white, " title="Black, Clothing, Chest, Beauty, Model, Muscle, Brassiere, Abdomen, Lip, Black-and-white, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2-1567012110.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Emily Rosario, 28, delivered via a planned C-section after suffering from placenta previa, a condition where the placenta covers the cervix.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Stomach, Skin, Chest, Navel, Trunk, Muscle, Shoulder, Arm, Joint, " title="Abdomen, Stomach, Skin, Chest, Navel, Trunk, Muscle, Shoulder, Arm, Joint, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2-1567011141.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>“The recovery was so hard,” says Rosario. “Imagine having to wake up every two hours because of the baby, while trying to heal from major surgery.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=100 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The big exercise ball?

As a society we really need to support these mothers and give them the best experience possible, even when things get complicated.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=108 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In many ways, women have begun taking control of the narrative around C-sections, working to reduce the stigma, correct the misconceptions, and make it clear that becoming a mother is something to celebrate, even when it leaves a scar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=109 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delfino says she’s proud to show off her C-section scar.
