Afterward, members of the Fraternity wore their canes with pride, since it was the emblem of a Gentleman who exhibited these attributes.</p><p></p><h3>When and why did Kappa Alpha Psi decide to alter their name?</h3><p>The word Fraternity, as well as the image it conveyed, was of crucial significance to them. The Founders were compelled to alter the name of the Fraternity as a result of these events. The name of the fraternity was formally changed to Kappa Alpha Psi in December 1914, after the adoption of a resolution at the Grand Chapter Meeting. On April 15, 1915, this modification became effective.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly does the name Kappas stand for?</h3><p>On May 15, 1911, the organisation that is currently known as Kappa Alpha Psi was officially established as a national corporation under the name Kappa Alpha Nu.
