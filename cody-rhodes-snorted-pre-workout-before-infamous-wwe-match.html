His enthusiasm, commitment, and skill in the ring have always been evident throughout his career, and he has delighted innumerable fans with his amazing agility and charisma. However, he recently spoke about the time he snorted a pre-workout before a WWE match in his early days.</p><p>The American Nightmare returned to WWE after six years at WrestleMania 38 Day 1 as the surprise opponent of Seth “Freakin” Rollins. He came back after six years away from the company and made a name for himself outside the global juggernaut. He had a previous run with the company that included a lot of interesting moments as well.</p><p>Later that year Cody Rhodes was highly praised for his performance at WWE Hell in a Cell, against Seth Rollins, with a torn pectoral muscle. The match that won him the “Match of the Year” award. After recovering, Cody came back after seven months and won the Royal Rumble match <a href=#>to secure main event match at WrestleMania 39</a> for the Undisputed WWE World championship.</p><p>Cody Rhodes spoke to <a href=#>HOT 106 with Mike D</a> for a recent interview where he went into an infamous match from his early days in WWE. Moreover, Rhodes disclosed that he snorted a pre-workout before the bout and delivered some famous words to Michael Hayes backstage.</p><p>“There is a legendary wrestler, now he’s a producer, [Vice President], writer, Michael Hayes. He was in charge of whatever I was doing that night, I believe it was a three-segment tag match. I don’t know if it was being young, arrogant, or braggart. He asked me what we were going to do out there and I legitimately snorted pre-workout to be funny. I don’t know what I was thinking. It was a very strong pre-workout. I did it and I told him, ‘it doesn’t matter what we do out there, we’re going to tear the roof off this place.’ Famous last words. Then disaster struck.</p><p>In the first segment of the three segments. One guy got kicked below the waist twice. That was Bad News Barrett. Tried real hard to get back to where we were, got kicked below again. The next thing you know, Daniel Bryan hits a dropkick in the corner and Ted DiBiase Jr gets pinned. Doesn’t get up. That’s in one segment. Two segments (not filled) on television that we’re supposed to do something, there was a lot of frustration. I rolled to the outside realizing this was probably the worst match in history [of the arena]. Rolled to the outside, tried to salvage it, told the guy next to me, ‘We should go in there and jump him. Let’s jump him.’</p><p>By the time I finished saying that, he was so angry, I turned to look back and he was already marching to the back, Bad News Barrett, furious over this terrible segment. Okay, we’re not jumping. I walk to the back, there’s Vince (McMahon) standing up, headset off, you know you’re in trouble. Ted thought he kicked out, he looked at him and before Vince could yell at us, he said, ‘Where is that referee? He was trying to [fuck] on us.’ The way he worded it, everyone was staring at him. There is no justice in this, the referee, Rod Zapata, he’s still with WWE, great referee. Vince called him over, ‘Hey ref, you were totally out of position.’ He’s validating Ted. He said, ‘I know sir, but on covers that face the hard camera, I can’t block the hard cam.’</p><p>Vince put the headset back on, ‘Yeah, you’re right,’ sat back down, Ted was stewing, Wade is punching a wall, I told Michael we were going to tear the roof off, Michael is shaking his head. The worst part of it all, in the worst match I ever had in the history of my time at WWE, the worst part of it all, we thought they would edit it a little bit. I watched it all happen back. It’s like somebody in the office said, ‘Just let these young guys know they suck. They’re not tearing the roof off.’ I made up for it when I came back for Backlash, last time I was here, I had a great match with Seth Rollins.”</p><p>Cody Rhodes is gearing up for his main event world championship match against Roman Reigns at WrestleMania. However, it looks like we might see Rhodes battle LA Knight after the latter invited him for a match on tonight’s edition of Monday Night RAW.</p><p>Do you think Cody Rhodes vs LA Knight would happen on RAW tonight? If Yes, who will win the match?
