Other stars who have visited the country include Diane Kruger and Norman Reedus, Hugh Jackman, Chris Hemsworth, Matt Damon and Shakira.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Costa Rica is on everyone’s bucket list,” says Alicia Repetto of Costa Rica hospitality group <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Casa Chameleon Hotels</a>. “The country has so many things to offer with wonderful sceneries that change in a short drive. Its people, colors, gastronomy and culture are a delight to experience.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The biodiverse North American paradise, though, is far more than a burgeoning celebrity hotspot. “Costa Rica, home to over 500,000 species of wildlife, emphasizes the dominance of nature,” says Harry Shum Jr., who was born there. “The country’s motto, ‘Pura Vida,’ reflects a commitment to a pure and fulfilling life, as evidenced by its high life expectancy.” About a quarter of the country’s land mass is protected. “Costa Rica is the promised land without artificial ingredients,” adds Costa Rican film director Laura Astorga, describing the country as a place where “we can swim in always warm waves, where we can be very long-lived, where it is possible to see any wild animal up close because they are not afraid of us — we have never been their predators.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Some 2.5 million tourists visit annually for lush rainforest adventures, volcanic hot springs, magnificent beaches, surfing, yoga and incredible wildlife (such as humpback whales, sloths, jaguars, scarlet macaws and superpods of spinner dolphins). Costa Rica contains nearly 6 percent of the world’s biodiversity, yet it’s a bit smaller than West Virginia. Its Nicoya Peninsula is also one of the globes’s five Blue Zones, where people historically live long, healthy lives (residents live to an average age of 85). AOL co-founder Steve Case likens Costa Rica to “Hawaii 50 years ago.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Palmares-Outpost-Waterbike.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to Jason Moloney, artistic director and co-owner of prototyping and design company JxJ, “There’s a sense of adventure in the untouched wilderness that is impossible to fabricate.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It doesn’t hurt that there is an ever-increasing number of glamorous, exclusive and ultra-luxurious places to call home base — from sprawling resorts to private villas and residences — many of which have bowed in the northwest part of the country on two peninsulas.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Peninsula Papagayo</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">From an Oscar-winning leading lady to an actress and her rocker beau, many Hollywood types have been guests — and are owners — at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peninsula Papagayo</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 1,400-acre low-density, high-security sanctuary comprises multiple resorts and real estate developments, plus a private club, art program, marina for yachts up to 200 feet, and naturalist-guided activity outfitter (think mangrove water biking, outrigger canoeing and surfing Witch’s Rock). Liberia <a href=# id=auto-tag_international_1 data-tag=international>International</a> Airport (LIR), a 40-minute drive away, is being renovated to include a new private jet terminal, expected in 2024.

Designed by Sarco Architects, it sits on an ultra-private plot where a sandy beach and dry forest canopy converge and is staffed by 20 attentive hospitality and wellness professionals who orchestrate magical adventures, fine dining experiences and cultural immersions for their guests with incredible attention to detail and personal interests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Avellana_BAJA_455.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sims and Stuber have stayed at the peninsula’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Four Seasons Resort</a> (from $1,200), which <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sims has praised</a> for “customizing our trip completely — Momma did not lift one finger unless it was her wine glass to her mouth.” This November, the resort debuts the Eastern Mediterranean-inspired Virador Beach Club, complete with an adults-only infinity pool and cabanas, and a new biophilic hilltop Wellness Shala for cacao ceremonies, yoga and sound healing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FS-Virador-Beach-Club.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Film and TV producer Hank Leukart returned this year to his favorite getaway spot, the “gorgeous” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Andaz Costa Rica</a> at Peninsula Papagayo (from $600). “It fits into the natural surroundings perfectly,” he says. “We loved it so much, I proposed to my girlfriend, Parker, while kayaking at the resort.” The Andaz features new locally sourced restaurant Ostra and a fresh collection of condo residences with rooftop terraces and plunge pools.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ANDAZ_COSTA_RICA_OSTRA_RESTAURANT_SALON-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Just north of the Papagayo peninsula, Chris Burch’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>NIHI luxury brand</a> — Jennifer Lawrence <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">honeymooned at the original Sumba, Indonesia, resort</a> — is currently developing the 2,471-acre NIHI Santo Tomás, to open with two private beaches, a Ronald Zurcher–designed 40-room hotel and polo fields in 2025, with residences to come.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screen-Shot-2023-11-17-at-7.46.16-PM.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Even further north —&nbsp;on the country’s uppermost peninsula closest to Nicaragua (an hour from LIR airport) — is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Costa Elena</a>, a new eco-luxury community and ocean club with 10 miles of virginal coastline, renowned for kite-surfing and snorkeling. It borders the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Area de Conservació Guanacaste, where jaguars and yellow-necked parrot have been revived from near extinction in the last 18 years. Homesites start at $350,000 and five-bedroom turnkey villas begin at $2.95 million (four-bedroom villas start at $1,308/night). Its first private beach club opened in December 2022 with thatched-roof palapas and an infinity pool, while a grill restaurant bows this fall. Rafael Nadal has been a guest of nearby, all-inclusive <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dreams Las Mareas Resort</a> (from $740), where all Costa Elena owners and guests can access pools, spa, gym and further dining outlets.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Nicoya Peninsula</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">South of Papagayo is the larger Nicoya Peninsula, a longevity hotspot Blue Zone, where 15 years ago Case’s investment firm Revolution Places purchased the Cacique Peninsula. They’ve spent a decade planning <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Waldorf Astoria Residences Guanacaste</a> — due in 2024 — comprising 19 condo residences (from $1.62 million), 22 estate homes (from $5.31 million) and a 190-key hotel, with sustainability top of mind. Case tells THR he was personally drawn to Guanacaste for its “rare experience — beautiful pristine land, breathtaking beaches and ocean access, along with a welcoming culture.” The Waldorf Astoria property will include a beach club, treehouse-like spa rooms, a holistic wellness center, lap and thermal pools and multiple restaurants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NQS_IMI-LIVING_WA-COSTA-RICA_VIEW-07_VIEW-FROM-POOL_ER.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The region also is home to the car-free coastal town <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Las Catalinas</a>, which will open its first commercial center, La Rambla, late next year, with residences, dining, offices and retail. The uber-walkable master-planned enclave is home to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Casa Chameleon at Las Catalinas</a> (from $745), which has drawn actors, NBA players, singers and models. The spirited and secluded adults-only hotel sits atop a hill, which provides each of its 21 private villas — complete with personal infinity pools — with jaw-dropping vistas. Four fully serviced residences (starting at $4.29 million) and 15 luxe condos (from $1.27 million) are slated to be completed in late 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Casa-Chameleon-Las-Catalinas.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The freshly renovated, all-suite <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>El Mangroove, Autograph Collection</a> (from $457), is almost sold out of its own new residential offering.

It’s the latest hotel from the bohemian brand that helped popularize Tulum (Paris Hilton has stayed at that retreat) and will have 45 low-environmental-impact rooms and 10 glamping tents across a verdant beachfront, with offerings including underwater volcano snorkeling, beach horseback riding, waterfall excursions and hydrofoil surfing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Also in Santa Teresa, the beachfront boutique hotel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nantipa</a> (from $480) debuts eight new bungalows in November, as well as a longevity-inspired package (starting at $3,485 for three nights/double occupancy) called the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Wellness Experience</a>, which includes hiking to the Montezuma waterfall, a private dinner on the sand and volunteering at a nonprofit coastal ranch called Cirenas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ninta-Beachfront-Bungalow-Nantipa.png><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Farther South</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The coast grows less developed and arguably wilder as one travels south.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On a trip with film producer and underwater photographer Pier Nirandara’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_travel_1 data-tag=travel>travel</a> company <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ImmersivExpeditions</a>, Moloney fell in love with the country’s remarkable blend of natural beauty and eco-consciousness. He was sworn to secrecy on their locations, but Moloney tells THR of a few unforgettable memories: “Swimming with thousands of dolphins in crystal clear waters, watching toucans soar over secret beaches, and hearing the ghostly calls of howler monkeys as the rains come in.” Another highlight was a close encounter with a pod of orcas: “Witnessing the enormous size of such intelligent creatures move as a unit and watch us with an eerily prescient curiosity was a deeply moving experience,” he says.&nbsp; Nirandara is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">guiding a similar journey</a> March 1-8, 2024, for $5,300/person.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Astorga — who is working on a very personal film called Animal Lluvioso about crimes against environmental activists —&nbsp;says her favorite place is the Golfo Dulce, a gulf on the Oso Peninsula. “The whales arrive there with their calves to raise them,” she says. About 90 minutes north of there, in Uvita, lies the eight-suite, adults-only boutique hotel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kurà</a> (from $945), built by an architect and a biologist and serving 100 percent sustainably sourced meals at its restaurant.

Indeed, the central regions of Costa Rica are full of infinite adventures amid half a dozen active volcanoes, dense mountains, and jurassic rainforests teeming with monkeys and hundreds of bird species.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the north, Mick Jagger has stayed at the luxuriously intimate, ultra-sustainable <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins Lodge</a> (from $908, including activities), which opened in 2019 on 111 acres that include a waterfall.
