The new wearable comes with several improvements over the original Pixel Watch, such as a faster processor, a more accurate heart rate sensor, a skin temperature sensor, a stress management feature, and a personal safety check feature.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 also runs on the latest Wear OS 4.0, which promises smoother performance, seamless updates, and dynamic theme support. Here is everything you need to know about the Google Pixel Watch 2: its release date, price, specs, and features.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pixel_Watch_2_Release_Date_and_Availability></span> Pixel Watch 2 Release Date and Availability<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Watch rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Pixel Watch</a> 2 is available for pre-order starting October 4, 2023, alongside the Google Pixel 8 and Google Pixel 8 Pro smartphones. The official release date is October 12, 2023, when the devices will start shipping to customers. The Pixel Watch 2 will be available in 30 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, India and Japan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Price_and_variants></span>Price and variants<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 has two variants: a Wi-Fi-only model and a 4G LTE model. The Wi-Fi-only model costs $349 in the US, while the 4G LTE model costs $399. The prices may vary depending on the country and the carrier. For example, in India, the Pixel Watch 2 is priced at Rs. 39,990 for the Wi-Fi-only model and Rs. 44,990 for the LTE model.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 also comes in four color options: Matte Black/Obsidian, Polished Silver/Bay, Champagne Gold/Hazel and Polished Silver/Porcelain. The watch bands are made of fluoroelastomer with a soft-touch coating and are interchangeable with other standard 20mm bands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pixel-Watch-2-Design-and-display.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Design_and_display></span>Design and display<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 has a similar design to the original Pixel Watch, with a circular AMOLED display and a digital crown on the right side. However, there are some subtle changes that make the new watch lighter and sleeker. The watch case is made of 100% recycled aluminum, which reduces the weight by 10% compared to the stainless steel case of the first generation. The crown is also larger and more flush with the silhouette for easier access and navigation.</p><p>The display size remains unchanged at 1.2 inches, but the cover glass is thinner and domed for a more elegant look. The display has a pixel density of 320ppi and a peak brightness of 1000 nits. It also supports always-on display by default, which shows the time and other relevant information without waking up the screen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Performance_and_battery_life></span>Performance and battery life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 is powered by a new quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chipset, which is designed specifically for smartwatches. It also has a low-power co-processor that handles less demanding tasks such as driving the always-on display. Together with the new Wear OS 4.0 operating system, the new chipset delivers faster and smoother performance than the previous generation.</p><p>The battery capacity of the Pixel Watch 2 is slightly increased to 306mAh from 294mAh of the original model. According to Google, this allows the watch to last up to 24 hours with always-on display enabled. The watch also supports fast charging via a USB-C cable that attaches to four physical pins on the back of the watch. Google claims that it can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes, up to 80% in about 43 minutes and up to 100% in about 75 minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pixel-Watch-2-Health-and-fitness-features.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Health_and_fitness_features></span>Health and fitness features<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 comes with several new health and fitness features that are powered by Fitbit’s technology and Google’s AI. The watch has three new sensors that enable more accurate heart rate tracking, skin temperature tracking and stress management.</p><p>The heart rate sensor has multiple LEDs that cover more surface area on the back of the watch. This produces more accurate readings than ever before, especially for vigorous activities like HIIT, spinning and rowing. The heart rate sensor also works with an improved AI algorithm that can detect high and low heart rate notifications and provide daily readiness scores based on your heart rate variability.</p><p>The skin temperature sensor tracks your skin temperature at night to reveal insights into your sleep quality and monitor for changes in your overall wellness. The watch also supports sleep tracking with Fitbit’s Sleep Score feature which gives you a comprehensive view of your sleep stages and duration.</p><p>The cEDA (continuous electrodermal activity) sensor measures your skin’s response to stress using a machine learning algorithm that incorporates heart rate, heart rate variability, and skin temperature data. When the algorithm detects physical indicators of positive or negative stress, including excitement, it will send you a notification on the watch. It will then prompt you to either reflect on how you feel at that moment or take actions to reduce your stress, such as guided breathing or a mindfulness session.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 also supports automatic workout detection for seven different activities: walking, running, cycling, swimming, elliptical, rowing, and HIIT. The watch will start and stop tracking your workout automatically when it senses that you have begun or ended your activity. You can also manually start and stop your workouts using the Google Fit app on your watch or phone. The watch can track various metrics such as calories burned, distance, pace, heart rate zones, and Active Zone Minutes.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 also comes with a six-month Fitbit Premium membership that gives you access to more personalized insights, guidance, and content on the Fitbit app. You can also enjoy a one-month trial of YouTube Music Premium which lets you listen to your favorite music without ads and download songs directly to your watch to listen offline.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.newsunzip.com/technology/ola-give-india-free-500-oxygen-concentrators-bengaluru/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Ola & Give India To Provide Free 500 Oxygen Concentrators in Bengaluru</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Other_features_and_apps></span>Other features and apps<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 comes with several other features and apps that make it a smart companion for your daily life. One of the new features is the Personal Safety Check, which lets you set a timer when you are out for a run or walking alone at night. If the timer expires with no response from you, the watch will share your location with your emergency contacts and call 911 if you are in the US.</p><p>The watch also has a Fall Detection feature that can detect if you have had a hard fall and connect you to emergency services if you are unresponsive. You can also use the Emergency SOS feature to quickly call for help by pressing and holding the crown for five seconds.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 2 also brings Google’s apps and services to your wrist, such as Google Assistant, Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Pay and Photos. You can use Google Assistant to get answers, control your smart home devices, set reminders and more with just your voice. You can also use Gmail and Calendar to stay on top of your emails and appointments. You can use Google Maps to get turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates on your watch. You can use Google Pay to make contactless payments with just a tap of your wrist. You can also use Google Photos to view your memories and create custom watch faces with your favorite pictures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Summary></span>Summary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 is a refined and powerful smartwatch that offers several improvements over the original Pixel Watch.
