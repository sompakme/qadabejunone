Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.<h2>How do you deal with someone who lies to you?</h2><p>Here are 10 strategies for detecting and responding to lying:</p><li>Love truth. ...</li><li>Forget body language – focus on the words. ...</li><li>Tell them you value honesty. ...</li><li>Observe what happens when details are questioned. ...</li><li>Ask open-ended questions. ...</li><li>Don't let on that you know they're lying. ...</li><li>Watch for the evidence of patterns of dishonesty.</li><h2>What does the Bible say about Gaslighting?</h2>God is always trustworthy, but it can be difficult to trust even Him at first.
