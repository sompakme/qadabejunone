Examination of the financial statements and other documentation of the company belongs to the auditor’s responsibility.</p><h2>Who is an auditor?</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">An auditor</a>, or CPA (Certified Public Accountant), or CA (Chartered Accountant) is an independent professional who performs audits, ensure the reliability and accuracy of the financial information provided in financial statements prepared by the directors of the company. An audit can also be requested by the third parties that would like to be engaged in business with the firm. A qualified Chartered Accountant’s job is to give a professional and unbiased opinion about the company’s affairs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f5f40a47528d8f21.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>FUTMINNA eportal: An electronic online platform of the Federal University of Technology, Minna</span></p></a><h2>How to become an auditor?</h2><p class=align-left>Auditors are obliged to finish studies not only in an ordinary college or university but the American Institute of CPAs. Only an auditor is allowed to perform audits of the companies as he is required to pass a test conducted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and get a license issued by this institution.</p><h2>What professional skills, qualifications, and knowledge are required to become an auditor?</h2><p class=align-left>Why the auditor’s job is considered attractive is because it is usually well-paid. If you are familiar with finance, have extensive experience in the field of economics, finance, and accounting, you may try yourself in the role of a financial auditor. However, it is not easy to do auditor’s job. A good auditor needs to possess a bunch of professional knowledge, skills, and qualifications.</p><p class=align-left>As for the professional skills, an auditor should be knowledgeable in financial legislation, preparation of business documents, various production processes of the company, financial software, SFAS (Statements of Financial Accounting Standards) rules and other. A desirable auditor’s skills include speaking a foreign language, computer literacy, ability to quickly identify errors and violations in the financial documentation, presentation skills, attention to detail, thoroughness, objectivity and so on. Some of the most crucial auditor qualifications include legal compliance, corporate finance, SFAS (Statements of Financial Accounting Standards) rules and other.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/500282681e23df2f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bank guarantee: definition, types, principles of work and example</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As mentioned above, auditor’s job is well-paid, but it is quite difficult, especially, for the beginners. It may be stressful, time- and effort consuming. Auditors can work either for the government, private organisations or run their private practice. Another reason to choose this career path is that it features an increasing demand in the labour market, so you would never stay without work if you have gained a degree in this field.</p><h2>What are the duties of an auditor?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f5f40a47528d8f21.jpg><p class=align-left>In the beginning, organisations relied only on an accountant who assisted in keeping records, prepared the journal entries and wrote the annual financial statements. A small company does not necessarily need to perform an internal examination of its activity. Big companies, however, often lack a more sophisticated investigation of its records.</p><p class=align-left>Increased demand in independent auditors has arisen during the last decade. Due to the new requirements, every company has to be audited every year. An auditor is a new accountant, but he doesn't work for the company which means that he is on the opposite side of the barricade.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/32e238e44454365a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to establish a Public Limited Company in Nigeria?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Big organisations usually have their internal auditors; however, they are also subject to an independent examination performed by an independent specialist, an external auditor. An external auditor is asked to complete the similar tasks as an internal professional, but he is usually hired by a third party or a government institution to ensure the internal auditor financial reports are independent and unbiased.</p><h3>What does an auditor do?</h3><p class=align-left>When talking about what are the everyday duties of the auditor, his services can be divided into three main groups related to the following areas of finance:</p><p class=align-left>● Tax</p><p class=align-left>● Audit/assurance</p><p class=align-left>● Management</p><p class=align-left>The primary responsibility of an external auditor is to report to the company staff.

The primary goal of an auditor is to make sure that the financial statement and other documentation don’t contain any errors. The thing is every audit is unique as it depends on the current situation of the company. Even if an auditor is performing the same procedures, the examinations may differ depending on the scope of work, size, the age of the company, the correctness of the information provided in the reports, etc.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Supermarket business plan in Nigeria</p><h3>What an auditor doesn't do</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/500282681e23df2f.jpg><p class=align-left>While an auditor has a lot of responsibilities and powers, there are, however, some things an auditor is not allowed to do or just cannot.

There are some things auditors cannot do. For example, auditors cannot take responsibility for the results of the check of the financial reports, records and other documentation on which they form an opinion. It applies only to external auditors. One cannot expect the auditors to take responsibility for the audit results because they are supposed to be independent examiners. Auditors do not belong to the management team which means that the responsibility for financial statement presentation lies only in the hands of the organisation being audited.</p><h2>How is the audit conducted?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cf3d3230685d408e.jpeg><p class=align-left>An audit is performed by an independent body and aimed at the determination of the current financial position of the individual, company or organisation.

After completing an audit, an auditor writes an audit report, in which he explains what he has done and gives his opinion on the company checked. Generally speaking, all the companies are required to undergo an external audit once a year. However, only non-profit organisations are not subject to an examination.</p><p class=align-left>When an audit is to be conducted, the company's accountant prepares an annual financial report. It is vital that the reports and other documentation be prepared following reporting standards. The next step is to approve the internal financial report which belongs to the organisation's managers and directors duties. It is crucial that an auditor maintains independence from the company management to make an unbiased opinion on the company’s activity.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8a03808848817c2b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>NPower recruitment process and requirements in 2024: all the info you need</span></p></a><p class=align-left>An audit has typically two goals. First, to determine whether the financial managers have done everything possible to ensure the accuracy of the financial report. Second, to gain an understanding of the company's activities during the reporting period and evaluate the risks that might influence the company’s financial situation as well as the measures, or controls undertaken by the company to lower the risk. Auditor has to make a judgement on the accuracy of the financial information, the financial results and assess their compliance with financial reporting standards.</p><h2>Advantages and disadvantages of an auditor's job</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/32e238e44454365a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Auditor’s job has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one side, it is a prestigious and high-paid job. On the other hand, it is not easy to be an auditor because this job implies possessing advanced skills and qualifications.</p><h3>Advantages:</h3><ul><li>Increasing demand in the labour market;</li><li>High earnings.</li></ul><p class=align-left>When talking about the advantages of the auditor job, the best thing about it is that you can communicate with many people, make essential acquaintances and so on.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt42o5r5icb4p.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Working at Nigerian Breweries: Salary</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another advantage is that you don’t have to an external auditor from the very beginning but start with the career of an internal auditor. This way, you will be able to develop your professional skills gradually.</p><h3>Disadvantages:</h3><ul><li>A lack of stable working schedule;</li><li>No right to make a mistake during the auditing;</li><li>A massive amount of information to process;</li><li>Frequent and long trips;</li><li>High requirements to the job candidate who needs to have appropriate operational experience in the field.</li></ul><p class=align-left>When talking about disadvantages, they are probably few but significant. If you are aiming at becoming an auditor, you need to have a strong desire to work in the field of finance and accounting. This job implies performing various complicated tasks in a short amount of time and with no mistake. Those who are not stress resistant will probably find this job quite a stressful one.</p><h2>What is the difference between an accountant and an auditor?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ab95935d38048e76.jpg><p class=align-left>Many confuse the auditor and accountant jobs as they seem to be similar. In reality, they differ to a great extent. While every auditor can be an accountant (bookkeeper), this does not apply to the accountants as they mostly perform less complicated tasks. The truth is both careers belong to the field of accounting, but the duties, the salary of these professionals are different.</p><p class=align-left>An accountant is doing a lot of calculations, prepare financial statements, annual reports, balance sheets that is why his work is quite monotonous. An auditor is required to conduct complicated tasks too, but they are more related to detecting fraud, mistakes and analysing the company’s performance. That is true that the auditor’s job is quite prestigious. The auditors get more money for performing their duties. The point the accountant job implies fewer responsibilities, but it is in lower demand.</p><h2>Auditor’s salary</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to glassdoor.com</a>, in 2019, an average salary of an external auditor will start at N116,000 and reach around N10,450,000 per year depending on the company.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p class=align-left>Now you know to the question "Who is an auditor?" To summarise, an auditor has to express an opinion on whether the accountant has included in the financial statement and annual report fair information about the company’s activity. To make his opinion about the company’s performance, the auditor needs to gather appropriate and sufficient evidence by conducting tests, questionnaires, checks, and so on. An auditor has to form an opinion about whether the financial statement and annual report are free of fraud, technical errors.</p><p class=align-left>In conclusion, we’d like to say that the career of an auditor is quite prestigious but demanding. It gives many opportunities for making high earnings, constant development and even travelling around the world. While auditor’s career requires putting a lot of effort into it, it is worth trying to gain experience in this field.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>What are the phases required in preparing an audit in your business?</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN%2BkWtuaWWnnbxurdSdoK2nomKxtsDInqpnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shawn-mendes-stitches-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Shawn Mendes                                          Stitches lyrics    ">&larr;
