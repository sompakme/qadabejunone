After they return to Castle Leoch, Jamie gives Claire the <b>silver ring</b>.</span></span><h2>What is Claire's wedding ring made from in Outlander?</h2>And it is that ring, crafted by Murtagh out of silver from Jamie's mother's candle stick, that we see Claire receive in tonight's episode, as a replacement for the one Bonnet stole. Gabaldon was a fan of the show's solution. "Oh I thought it was very clever how they did it.<h2>What key was Claire's ring made of in Outlander?</h2>Is there significance to it? (note I have only read Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, and am about halfway through Voyager). Example - on TV, her ring is the second of 3 conditions Jamie required for their wedding, and was given to her during the ceremony. It was fashioned from a key to Lallybroch.<h2>Why is Frank's ring so important to Claire?</h2>Claire cared for this man who had been a solid part of her life from her teenage years. That ring was the connection to Frank and the love they once shared together. It was the link to the feelings she would always have of him, and most were certainly positive.<h2>How did bonnet get Claire's ring?</h2>In Drums of Autumn, Stephen Bonnet does get his hands on one of Claire's wedding rings after attacking the boat, but it's not Jamie's. No, Claire successfully swallows Jamie's ring and saves it.<h2>Outlander | Jamie Argues With Claire About His Secret Marriage</h2><p></p><h2>Why does Claire wear Jamies ring on her right hand?</h2>She tools Franks ring off before she got married so the left hand was free just curious ??? It makes more sense in the book, because Claire left Frank's ring on during the ceremony and that's why she wore Jamie's father's ring (and later her silver wedding band) on her right hand.<h2>Why does Claire marry John GREY?</h2>The books reveal how Claire had married the Lord in order to gain protection after she thought Jamie was dead. Their relationship develops through the eighth novel and, when Jamie finally returned, he was surprised at what he discovered.<h2>Does Claire love Jamie more than Frank?</h2>As viewers will know, Claire does return to Frank for her safety before eventually going back into the past to be with Jamie. However, it is never explicitly stated whether Frank or Jamie loved her more in the series.<h2>Does Claire ever get Jamies ring back?</h2>Furious, first for Jamie's gambling and then that he would even ask for her ring, Claire gives him both of her rings. Jamie ends up winning, and returns the rings to Claire.<h2>Does Claire ever take off Frank's wedding ring?</h2>Throughout Outlander, Claire was seen wearing two wedding rings – both when she married her second husband Jamie and when she returned to the future and reconciled with Frank Randall (Tobias Menzies). Claire steadfastly refused to take off the gold wedding band from Frank after travelling back through time.<h2>What did Claire's ring say?</h2>Eventually, Jamie reveals why he'd given Murtagh one of his mother's candlesticks last episode: He'd asked him to fashion a new wedding ring for Claire, with an inscription that translates to “Give me a thousand kisses,” a reference to their special poem.<h2>What does the dragonfly symbolize in Outlander?</h2>This Dragonfly is the only good Claire has when she has to go back through the stones. She can't give anything else to Jamie that could symbolize the strength of her love. This symbol that Jamie serves against him as he dies on the Culloden Heath.<h2>What does the Dragonfly in Amber represent?</h2>The title Dragonfly in Amber refers to a wedding gift that Claire received from Jamie's friend, Hugh Munro.<h2>What is an outlander ring?</h2>In the famous 'Outlander' novel, Jamie gives Claire a silver ring which is described in the book as “…a silver band, decorated in the Highland interlace style, a small and delicate Jacobean thistle bloom carved at the centre of each link…”.<h2>What hand do Scottish wear wedding rings?</h2>Culture and where one lives can also have an influence and determine which hand wedding rings are worn on and which hand engagement rings are worn on. Usually wedding rings are worn on the right hand. In some countries, however, they are worn on the left hand, like in France, Italy, Sweden, Scotland and Belgium.<h2>Who stole Emerald Outlander?</h2>And since one needs a gemstone to travel through time, we can guess what he wants with that emerald. Although we only see the back of his head, we can safely assume that this man is Wendigo Donner, the same man who abducted Claire at the end of season 5 (he wasn't among the men who assaulted her).<h2>How did Stephen Bonnet know about the jewels?</h2>He knows about the gems<p>Because of Jamie's help, Bonnet learns about the valuable gems. So, as a pirate, what does he do? He later jumps onto Claire and Jamie's ship and takes the gems and Claire's wedding ring from Frank. The only reason he doesn't murder or hurt anyone physically is because Jamie once saved him.</p><h2>Does Jamie get the treasure back?</h2>He told Jamie about a treasure hidden on an island, which was being guarded by a 'white witch' and it gave Jamie hope Claire was alive. He escaped the prison and swam to the island hoping to find his 'heart'. He didn't, but noticed the McKenzie family crest carved into a stone and found the 'treasure' behind it.<h2>Does Claire get her Lallybroch ring back?</h2>What happened to it, I thought Bree got it back?” In season four, Claire's ring goes missing after her run-in with the nefarious pirate and smuggler, Stephen Bonnet (Ed Speleers). Claire manages to keep hold of her gold ring from Frank, but Bonnet runs away with the silver jewellry from Lallybroch.<h2>How many husbands did Claire have in Outlander?</h2>So, technically, Claire has three husbands in the Outlander books.<h2>Did Claire sleep with King Louis in the book?</h2>Claire and Jamie have time to reconnect, but first, Jamie needs to know about King Louis. There is an element of jealousy about it. Despite Claire not telling him in the previous chapter, Jamie knows that Claire slept with the King.<h2>Why did Claire sleep with the King?</h2>6. Claire sleeps with King Louis XV to free Jamie from the Bastille. When Jamie goes to jail for illegally dueling Black Jack Randall in Paris, he's imprisoned in the Bastille. Claire, who miscarried their daughter Faith, goes to meet the king and plead for him to free Jamie so they can return to Scotland.<h2>Does Jamie sleep with Lord John?</h2>Claire, remembering a similar anniversary gift Jamie had given to her a decade earlier, faints. A week after her marriage to Lord John, she and John drunkenly sleep together. The following morning, both talk about Jamie and admit they are using each other to connect with Jamie's memory.<h2>Does Willie find out Jamie is his father?</h2>William meets Jane Pocock in a brothel in Philadelphia in June 1778, shortly after he learns—to his horror—that Jamie Fraser is his father. William pays to spend a night with Jane, in order to save her from a repulsive client Captain Harkness.<h2>Does Jamie kiss Lord John Grey?</h2>In September 1764, Lord John told Jamie he intended to marry Isobel Dunsany and become William's stepfather. Jamie offered his body to Lord John, who declined. Jamie kissed him.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lp5q%2FpnnToZxmal2ssqWwyKeeZqqZo7RuwMeaq2aikaK2pnnGmq2eZZOhrqq%2BxGakmpyVYrOzu8w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-griffin-gluck-dating-now-a-look-at-his-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-and.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Griffin Gluck Dating Now?
