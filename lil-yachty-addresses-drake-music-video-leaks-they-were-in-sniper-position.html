At least, that's how the Atlanta artist sees it, as he recently explained to his co-host MitchGoneMad on the A Safe Place podcast. Moreover, Yachty spoke on a clip from an eagle-eyed that went viral recently, in which he captured the two MCs <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">filming a music video in the woods</a>. In fact, one of the bars from the shoot mentions A$AP Rocky, which further raised interest in seeing what was going on. From Lil Boat's perspective, though, it was just downright creepy to have a die-hard find them like that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We were in the middle of bats**t nowhere, and it was like 3 o’clock in the morning," Lil Yachty remarked around the 4:25 mark of the video below. "I mean, in retrospect, you would assume how was anyone even around in the woods by a lake? Drake has just like these *nsane fans who follow him everywhere he goes. They were in sniper position. If somebody really wanted to do something, easily they could’ve took a headshot."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-yachty-feels-creeped-out-by-fan-who-caught-his-music-video-shoot-with-drake>Lil Yachty Feels Creeped-Out By Fan Who Caught His Music Video Shoot With Drake</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It has the most, I would say like the most ‘performance’ album he’ll have, as far as like energy," he explained. "I think some of the best Drake verses that I ever heard are on this album. Some of the verses I’m just like, ‘Bruh, what’s&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;with you?’ You know what I’m saying? People gonna have a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;to say about some of his topics on this album. And I don’t think he does it on purpose, I think it’s just him- he just has a real... I will say, he deals with some controversial things."

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZn11g5Fmm6uZm5p6rbXLZrCam5ipxm651KygnGWmnrGmu4yhoKllmKS9brrEsKo%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./maya-higa-biography-twitter-age-boyfriend-family-youtube-net-worth-height-twitch-sister-bi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maya Higa Biography: Twitter, Age, Boyfriend, Family, YouTube, Net Worth, Height, Twitch, Sister, Bi">&larr;
