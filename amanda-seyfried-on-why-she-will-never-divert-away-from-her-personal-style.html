As one of Hollywood’s most recognisable faces, you might assume that she wouldn't be fazed by it, but, like so many A-list actresses, she still struggles to feel at ease in the unusual situation. Posing in front of so many photographers will always have its challenges, she tells me, and no matter how much experience you have, it rarely feels like a natural thing to do.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I really enjoy experimenting with fashion on photoshoots, but the red carpet is a different animal; it’s very brief and it’s very frantic,” she says, speaking to me over Zoom from her kitchen table, dressed down in a cosy knit. “You don’t really have enough time. When I’m on a shoot, it feels more like acting – it’s more about the art in fashion, which is really fun for me. You can take as long as you like to feel comfortable and make the clothing work for you, which just isn’t really the case on the red carpet.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Amanda Seyfried and Clare Waight Keller at the 2018 Women of the Year Awards" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/e8936f31-9014-4652-9ae5-73c9284fa955/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1541159233_2588.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because of this, Seyfried feels that she has boundaries with red-carpet dressing, knowing what she will feel at ease in. The actress has been working with stylist Elizabeth Stewart for years, someone who she says truly understands her style.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Elizabeth is so savvy – she is so amazing and I trust her so much,” she says with a smile. “She has these incredible relationships with designers, and she always finds the pieces that she knows I will like. She understands what will look good on my body and she knows my boundaries with fashion, and I am so grateful for that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In terms of the process that goes into finding those amazing red-carpet looks, Seyfried says it is all down to Stewart, who brings a rack of clothes over to her house, which will always have something on that she’ll love. “It’s actually always very easy. Every once in a while – maybe once a year – I’ll see something in a magazine that I want to try, but almost always, it is something she has chosen, something she has put on hold, knowing I will love it.”</p><img alt="amanda seyfried" title="Portraits: 76th Venice Film Festival - Jaeger-LeCoultre Collection" width=3467 height=5200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amanda-seyfried-1-1671635747.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tristan Fewings</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Seyfried then, much of her focus in fashion is about her down time, where she chooses to wear things that prioritise comfort over anything else.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think my style has really always stayed in one place – it has evolved here and there and of course my body has changed when I’ve had kids, but I have always been one to wear sweatpants as often as I can, and when I wear jeans, it is going to be the same jeans I have had for years,” she explains. “It just works for me so I don’t move away from it. And look, I live on a farm for the most part now – no one is photographing me, so I just dress how I want.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This, to her, is what timeless style is all about: consistency. “I think it’s about not fitting into one era, you know, not fitting into a trend. For me, it’s really just been about what's comfortable over the years and so I feel in that sense that my style is timeless – I could be from anywhere, from any era; I never want to embrace trends or fleet from one thing to another.” She pauses, thoughtfully. “Maybe that’s because I’m just not brave enough, but I think that embracing what truly feels like you, and what you feel comfortable in is how you look your best.”</p><img alt="amanda seyfried" title="amanda seyfried" width=2124 height=3186 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amanda-seyfried-6-1671635680.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But comfort doesn't have to mean boring. While Seyfried may have her capsule wardrobe down to a T, she is all about investing in those very special pieces, those which elevate your everyday style.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Good jewellery is what I will invest in. It’s powerful because you can really embrace your own style with jewellery; you can make it your own. I will also invest in great shoes – I’ll overspend with them – and also I will spend money on cashmere, cosy jumpers I’ll wear forever, and a great watch.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As one of the faces of Jaegre-LeCoultre, she knows a lot about how to choose the right timepiece. Her top tips? “It has to be something that you are not afraid to wear all the time. It needs to be a watch that feels like it's part of you, and maybe you can’t remember a time when you didn’t have it, you can’t believe you used to not have it. You need to feel like, ‘How did I ever not own this? How did I walk around without this?’”</p><img alt="amanda seyfried" title="amanda seyfried" width=900 height=1350 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amanda-seyfried-3-1671635410.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><img alt="amanda seyfried" title="amanda seyfried" width=900 height=1350 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/amanda-seyfried-4-1671635433.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“And I think this can be the case for very luxurious, extravagant watches too,” she adds. “I remember when I first tried on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/jaeger-lecoultre/jewelry-and-watches/watches/rendez-vous-moon-serenity-automatic-36mm-18-karat-rose-gold-alligator-and-diamond-watch/19971654707507274 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rendez-Vous watch" data-vars-ga-product-id=7849d27b-86a2-4c5c-b046-3185eb2055bd data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/jaeger-lecoultre/jewelry-and-watches/watches/rendez-vous-moon-serenity-automatic-36mm-18-karat-rose-gold-alligator-and-diamond-watch/19971654707507274 data-product-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/shop/product/jaeger-lecoultre/jewelry-and-watches/watches/rendez-vous-moon-serenity-automatic-36mm-18-karat-rose-gold-alligator-and-diamond-watch/19971654707507274 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fjaeger-lecoultre%2Fjewelry-and-watches%2Fwatches%2Frendez-vous-moon-serenity-automatic-36mm-18-karat-rose-gold-alligator-and-diamond-watch%2F19971654707507274" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=JAEGER-LECOULTRE data-vars-ga-product-price=£41,000.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1b9cc76d-4d41-4c72-9ed0-fcdc93499108 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=JAEGER-LECOULTRE data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Rings class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Rendez-Vous watch</a> – and I could see why it would be intimidating to wear because of all the diamonds. But I remember doing a shoot wearing it, styled it with a simple black turtleneck, and the pictures were just extraordinary.

It's why this relationship has been successful for so many years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Jaegre-LeCoultre is the master of watchmaking. It’s great to work with a company which is built on precision and attention-to-detail – their value is in these incredibly beautiful pieces, and getting to understand everything that goes into the making of these is just so incredible. Everything becomes even more special.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Working in fashion, and having access to such beautifully made products, has clearly made Seyfried appreciative of the power behind what we wear. And, whether in full glam on the red carpet or dressed down on the farm, she knows how personal style can tell the story of who we are – which is why she never wants to divert far from what she knows she loves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Fashion is an extension of who we are and what we represent,” she says. “We are capable of expressing so much of ourselves in what we wear – it makes us feel seen before we even open our mouths.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudX6RcmppbGBkrq6tzZ2YZquVrrOztcSdZJ%2BZo522sLqMoqWtnaKrtqbDjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bella-thorne-shares-tweets-nude-photos-after-being-hacked-threatened.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bella Thorne Shares Tweets Nude Photos After Being Hacked, Threatened">&larr;
